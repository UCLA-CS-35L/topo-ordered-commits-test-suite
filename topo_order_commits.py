# Keep the function signature,
# but replace its body with your implementation.
#
# Note that this is the driver function.
# Please write a well-structured implemention by creating other functions
# outside of this one, each of which has a designated purpose.
#
# As a good programming practice,
# please do not use any script-level variables that are modifiable.
# This is because those variables live on forever once the script is imported,
# and the changes to them will persist across different invocations of the
# imported functions.
